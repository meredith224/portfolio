The intent of this project began with the goal to create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`, and then, using Bootstrap, develop the site with a nav bar, responsive links and images that tie right into the site.

The overall intent of the creation is to produce a Portfolio site/page/app that allows us to not only learn how to produce our portfolio across multiple forms (html, css, url, mobile app), we get to market ourselves to a wide array of audiences as we continue to learn more ourselves, and improve our products as our coding abilities continue to grow. 

Here I will preview the 3 main pages in my portfolio- Home, Portfolio and Contact, to give an idea of what this project has helped me achieve thus far.
