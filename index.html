          <br />
          <p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Meredith Hursh, and I am definitely excited to be immersing myself in the coding world these days. With previous experience in HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, and more, jumping back into coding right now makes the future look brighter than ever. Currently enrolled in the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp, I hope to increase my knowledge and improve my skills enough to pave my career path in the tech-sector of the business world.
            </p>
          <br />
          <p>Aside from my recent focus in computer science and technology, I have tended to have a natural pull towards marketing and advertising. My outgoing and bubbly personality have molded well with the social side of the business world, and in a lot of ways, that social aspect has actually taught me a decent portion of what has helped me create or influence a few very successful marketing game plans. My hope is that in improving my "behind-the-scene" skills in the coding realm meshes incredibly with what I have experience in right in the public eye, so I can combine skills on two seemingly very opposite ends of business in general.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>If I am not busy trying to improve my potential career path-wise, I love the outdoors. I have loved horses my whole life (and even competed in the Equestrian Junior Olympics when I was 18!), love the serenity of walking along the side of a creek, and adore laying out to look up at the stars on any clear night.
